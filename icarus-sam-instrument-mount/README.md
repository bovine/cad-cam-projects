https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1278951

Summary
-------
This is a custom 2-1/4" mounting plate for the LCD and switches for an Icarus SAM GPSS autopilot steering-assist module. The design is inspired by the original 2-1/4" mounting plate that was originally available from the manufacturer.

Print Settings
--------------
* Printer Brand: MakerBot
* Printer: MakerBot Replicator 2
* Rafts: Yes
* Supports: Yes

Notes:
There is some pretty severe overhang in this model, due to the side mounting screws that are needed to secure the LCD display, but since that is all on the back side of the mounting plate, none of the remnants of the support structure will be visible in the final installation. It's recommended that you print using ABS not PLA, since the cockpit environment can get very hot and will affect the strength of shape of PLA.
