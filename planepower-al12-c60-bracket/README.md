====================================

Summary
-------
The PlanePower AL12-C60 aircraft alternator has an installation manual that describes the fabrication of a bent metal bracket for supporting existing baffling away from the front of the alternator on some early Piper Cherokee 140 aircraft. PlanePower describes this fabricated bracket as part number 10-2008.

This Thing is a design file that can be used to plasma cut the precisely sized part from the prescribed piece of steel. After cutting, a metal brake must be used to add the two 90-degree bends in the design.

Here is a video of the plasma cutting of this bracket: http://youtu.be/tStQC6W6oEQ

As it turns out, not all Cherokee 140 installations will actually require the fabrication of this bracket. Perhaps it is only actually needed on models built in the 1960's.
