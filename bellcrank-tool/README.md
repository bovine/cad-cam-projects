Summary
-------
To adjust the aileron rigging of certain Piper PA28 aircraft, the service manual recommends fabricating a custom tool with specific measurements. This thing is a recreation of the specification of that tool.

Printing (or painting) this object in a bright safety color is recommended, to prevent accidentally leaving this tool installed.
