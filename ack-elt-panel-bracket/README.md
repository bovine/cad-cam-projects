Summary
-------
This is a mounting plate that can accept the remote switch from an ACK E-01 or E-04 aircraft ELT (emergency locator transmitter).

The outer dimensions of this panel were sized for a specific mounting position but you can edit the design to fit a specific panel opening of your choice. This specific plate was laser cut into a piece of acrylic, but other material and manufacturing choices can be used.

Or you can combine these cutout dimensions with one of my round instrument hole blanks and 3D print one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1275726
