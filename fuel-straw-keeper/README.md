Keeper for Aviation Fuel Measurement Straws
===========================================

This object clips onto any standard 1/2" diameter fuel gauge tube and prevents it from accidentally falling inside of the fuel tank. It additionally prevents the tube from rolling if you need to temporarily set the tube onto aircraft wing or another surface.
