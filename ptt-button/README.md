Replacement button cover for a push-to-talk trigger
===================================================

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:372979

Summary
-------
One of the retaining tabs on the cover to the push button of my airplane's yoke broke through normal usage, making activating the push-to-talk of the comm radio less convenient. The rest of the electrical and physical portions of my switch was still functional, so I only needed a replacement button face.

Print Settings
--------------
* Rafts: Yes
* Supports: No

Notes:
Due to the higher temperatures that might be encountered in an airplane cockpit parked out in the sun, you will probably want to print this object in ABS, which has a higher melting point than PLA. In practice, PLA would probably be adequate. I printed this with a raft because I was having problems with keeping the ABS adhered to the print bed, but you might be able to avoid the raft.

Post-Printing
-------------
Expect to need some light sanding with sandpaper or a Dremel to get the dimensions to fit precisely and to move smoothly in your existing switch mechanism.

For certified aircraft, the FAA allows the fabrication of owner- or operator-produced parts that are designed through reverse engineering of a factory part. Your A&P will need to sign your aircraft logbook to approve installation of this component as a "minor" alteration as being airworthy. For experimental aircraft, the owner can make the determination as to airworthiness.

How I Designed This
-------------------
This model was designed in Autodesk Inventor based upon careful measurements of the broken component. Other models of push-to-talk triggers may require modifications to the dimensions of this object.
