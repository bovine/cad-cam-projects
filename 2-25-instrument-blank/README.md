Summary
-------
In GA (general aviation) aircraft, the round instruments mounted in cockpit panels are generally one of two common sizes: 2-1/4" (57mm) and 3-1/8" (80mm). MS33638

These designs are intended to allow you to cover a hole where an instrument was previously mounted, for cosmetic reasons and to prevent hands or debris from going into the panel.

Print Settings
--------------
Notes:
It's recommended that you print using ABS not PLA, since the cockpit environment can get very hot and will affect the strength of shape of PLA.


Post-Printing
-------------

Mount using MS35214-27, 6-32 Instrument mounting screws, or equivalent.

You may need to use instrument mounting nuts (A8943-632-493), Tinnerman nuts, or 6-32 machine nuts if the screw fit is not secure enough.
