Camera mount bracket for Piper Cherokee tie-down ring
=====================================================

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:672380

Summary
-------
Piper Cherokee aircraft have a circular tie-down ring on the underside of both wings for anchoring the plane when parked. I designed this mounting plate to be used in pairs and sandwich around the tie-down hook so that an action camera mount (like a GoPro, Virb, Contour, Drift, etc) can be attached onto it.

This is designed to fit a Piper tie-down ring that has the following dimensions: outer diameter is 2 inches across, inner diameter hole is 1 inch across, and thickness of ¼ inch.

This bracket was loosely inspired by the following design, from which the accessory block and RAM mount can be utilized with this design, if desired: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:609142

Print Settings
--------------
* Rafts: No
* Supports: No

Instructions
------------
1. You will need to print two copies of the mount, preferably using ABS filament although PLA should work also.
2. You will also need two ¼"-20-1" screws, with matching washers and nuts. The photos depict using wing-screws and wing-nuts, which allows for tool-free installation/removal. Use of lock washers (star washers) or lock nuts might be desirable for added safety. The ¼"-20 size screw is used so as to be compatible with the common camera tripod mount.
3. You will probably need to use a round file to clean out printed holes so that your screws can be inserted and removed easily through the printed parts.
4. You will probably need to improvise a way to attach your camera-specific mount onto one of the ¼ inch bolts.
   * My photos for this project show a ball head camera mount, which will allow you to adjust the camera angle arbitrarily. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C3DY73S
   * Cameras that have a tripod-compatible screw hole might also be attached directly to one of the two screws through the mounting plant.
   * The accessory or RAM mount blocks from this other project might also be used: http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:609142
5. You may want to apply a thin layer of rubber (or RTV silicone, or Sugru, Plastidip) on the inside of the printed pieces to reduce slipping movement against the tie-down ring. Allow any such coatings to dry/cure fully before mounting.
