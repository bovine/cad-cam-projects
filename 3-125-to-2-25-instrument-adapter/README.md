========================================

Summary
-------
In general aviation aircraft, the round instruments mounted in cockpit panels are generally one of two common sizes: 2-1/4" (57mm) and 3-1/8" (80mm). MS33638

This thing is an adapter plate that allows you to utilize a 2-1/4" instrument in an aircraft panel hole that was designed to fit a 3-1/8" instrument.

The design is made so that the surface of the adapter should be able to sit flush with the surrounding panel, however the actual 2-1/4" instrument will be slightly recessed behind the inner cutout of the adapter. Traditionally purchased adapters of this style would normally have an inner overhang so that the 2-1/4" instrument can sit closer to the adapter's face, but this would unfortunately be more difficult to print.

Print Settings
--------------

Notes:
It's recommended that you print using ABS not PLA, since the cockpit environment can get very hot and will affect the strength of shape of PLA.


Post-Printing
-------------
Mount using MS35214-27, 6-32 Instrument mounting screws or equivalent.

You may need to use instrument mounting nuts (A8943-632-493), Tinnerman nuts, or 6-32 machine nuts if the screw fit is not secure enough.
