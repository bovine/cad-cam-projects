skateboard-battery-enclosure
============================

This is a customizable 3D-printable enclosure for the battery pack of a DIY electric skateboard. Although there are already a few different fixed-size models on Thingiverse already, I wanted to design this as a customizable OpenSCAD design because different people have very different battery sizes, configurations, and layouts.

For my personal use-case, I need to enclose a 10s2p battery pack that consists of 20x 18650 cells that are arranged in a flat layout of 2 columns of 10 cells. This means I wanted a battery case of approximately 140 mm x 190mm (5.5" x 7.5")
